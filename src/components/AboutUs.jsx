                    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">At Vanya Eco Products, we believe purity begins at the source. Thatâ€™s why we work hand-in-hand with trusted farmers, sourcing raw spices directly from the heart of Wayanadâ€™s fertile lands. Each spice is harvested with care, carrying the aroma of the soil and the strength of nature.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">From there, the journey continues in our very own mills. Here, tradition meets precision our spices are cleaned, processed, and ground in small batches, ensuring that what reaches your kitchen is as close to nature as possible.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Unlike commercial brands that stretch shelf life with chemicals and preservatives, we choose authenticity. Our products have a naturally shorter shelf life, because they are pure, unadulterated, and free from artificial additives. Every packet you open is filled with freshness, flavor, and the promise of good health.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">For us, itâ€™s not just about selling spices itâ€™s about preserving trust. When you choose Flavours by Vanya, youâ€™re not just cooking a meal, youâ€™re keeping alive a tradition of honesty, purity, and care that starts in the farmerâ€™s field and ends on your dining table.</p>

                    At Vanya Eco Products, weâ€™ve chosen not to sell through Amazon or supermarkets â€” not because itâ€™s easy, but because itâ€™s right.
                    Our products contain no preservatives or artificial stabilizers, giving them a shorter shelf life but unmatched freshness and purity.
                    We believe in direct connections â€” between the farmer, us, and you. Every pack is freshly ground, packed with care, and shipped straight from Wayanad.
                    Weâ€™re not chasing mass shelves; weâ€™re nurturing trust, freshness, and authenticity. Because for us, itâ€™s not just business â€” itâ€™s a promise from our land to your kitchen.
